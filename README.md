# Prokect TDS
This is the source code to my latest proof of concept: coined Project_TDS (Top Down Shooter).

## Overview
Project TDS is a 2D Top Down Shooter where the goal of the game is to survive as long as possible while racking in a high enough score. With the tride and true mechanics of shooters, this game also adds an additional layer of gameplay called `Bullet Time`, where if the player dodges an enemy shot at the last second, the entire level will slow down, except for the player for a short amount of time.

## Basic Controls
* WASD: Move
* Left Click: Fire
* Mouse: Rotate Character
* Space + WASD: Quick Dash
* Space: Dodge

- The player cannot dodge multiple times in a row; there is a slight cooldown after a dodge
- When the player performs a successful dodge, they cannot perform any more dodges until the dodge meter (bottom portion of the screen) fills up.

## Win Condition
The player survivies for as long as possible

## Lost Condition
The player loses all of their health to the enemies
